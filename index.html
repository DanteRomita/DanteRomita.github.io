                                This project is a suite of tools which greatly assists me in my day-to-day workflow.
                                It's also entirely client-side with no server component while also being hosted entirely
                                on GitHub Pages, meaning there's nothing to download, so only copy/pasting is needed!

                                One of the most useful type of tools in this collection is scripting building with an
                                intuitive, easy-to-use interface! There are many excellent open-source tools out there,
                                but a large subset of them are also command-line only. If GUIs for these programs do
                                exist, many do not encapsulate enough of the useful, regularly used features these
                                programs provide.
                            </p>

                                                these programs such that you can run them from the command line in any

                                            This tool will remove all line breaks from the input string. For
                                            example, suppose you copy/paste a paragraph from a PDF file.
                                            Sometimes, it will assume that every line in the paragraph is a new
                                            line in the copied string. In this case, you'd want to remove all
                                            line breaks from the string so the entire paragraph is a continuous
                                            string entirely on one line. Simply paste your text and the output
                                            will be generated for you automatically, which you can copy and
                                            paste wherever.

                                            enter/paste text to the site directly, which will remove all non-ASCII
                                            characters and display the output on the page, ready to copy.

                                            This tool is useful to those who want to link one or more files to their
                                            corresponding URL(s), often for the purposes of easily referring back to
                                            the original source of the file(s). For example, suppose you want to
                                            download an image from a <a
                                                href="https://www.tumblr.com/spicymochi/762699939136602112">Tumblr
                                                post</a>, but right-clicking it and selecting 'Save Image As' sets
                                            the filename to some random string. It's not easy to reference the post
                                            it came from.

                                            This tool allows you to convert a URL to a filename with a pre-defined
                                            convention, which you can then plug back into this tool to reference the
                                            post. Many of the major platforms are supported here, so simply
                                            copy/paste your file names/URLs and the tool will convert them for you.

                                            Oddly enough, there aren't many well-known commands for changing the
                                            case of a string's characters. Some applications do havre built-in
                                            commands, but as far as I know, they aren't streamlined across entire
                                            systems. This tool fills that gap, allowing you to change the case of a
                                            string's characters quickly, easily and in a variety of ways. The
                                            following string manipulation options are available to you:

                                            'Lisfify' is a pseudo-word which I define as verb which means 'to make a

                                            which will determine how the string is split into a list of strings. The
                                            output will automatically be displayed as you enter/paste your text,

                            Metropolitan University, an extracurricular activity all about game development. I was on the Operations team and was responsible for developing a website representing the central

                            landing page to displaying profiles for all of our of executives and beyond!
