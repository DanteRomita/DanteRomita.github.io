                                This project is a suite of tools which greatly assists me in my day-to-day workflow.
                                It's also entirely client-side with no server component while also being hosted entirely
                                on GitHub Pages, meaning there's nothing to download, so only copy/pasting is needed!

                            <p class="content">
                                One of the most useful type of tools in this collection is scripting building with an
                                intuitive, easy-to-use interface! There are many excellent open-source tools out there,
                                but a large subset of them are also command-line only. If GUIs for these programs do
                                exist, many do not encapsulate enough of the useful, regularly used features these
                                programs provide.
                            </p>

                                                using these tools, or they won't work! It is recommended to install
                                                these programs such that you can run them from the command line in any
                                                directory.

                                The string manipulation tools provided by this collection are incredibly useful for
                                quickly modifying your strings for various purposes. These are the tools currently

                                        This tool will remove all line breaks from the input string. For
                                        example, suppose you copy/paste a paragraph from a PDF file.
                                        Sometimes, it will assume that every line in the paragraph is a new
                                        line in the copied string. In this case, you'd want to remove all
                                        line breaks from the string so the entire paragraph is a continuous
                                        string entirely on one line. Simply paste your text and the output
                                        will be generated for you automatically, which you can copy and
                                        paste wherever.

                                        The script generating tools in this suite can only be successfully
                                        executed if there are only ASCII characters in both the script, as well
                                        as the file names. As such, this tool makes the process of removing
                                        non-ASCII characters as easy as possible. You can copy a PowerShell
                                        command to remove all non-ASCII characters from every file name in a
                                        director, you can upload files to rename them that way, or you can
                                        enter/paste text to the site directly, which will remove all non-ASCII
                                        characters and display the output on the page, ready to copy.

                                        corresponding URL(s), often for the purposes of easily referring back to
                                        the original source of the file(s). For example, suppose you want to

                                            post</a>, but right-clicking it and selecting 'Save Image As' sets
                                        the filename to some random string. It's not easy to reference the post

                                        This tool allows you to convert a URL to a filename with a pre-defined

                                        Oddly enough, there aren't many well-known commands for changing the
                                        case of a string's characters. Some applications do have built-in

                                        'Lisfify' is a pseudo-word which I define as verb which means 'to make a
                                        list'. This tool is useful to those who want to quickly make a list
                                        given a string. You can choose a custom delimiter (a single character)
                                        which will determine how the string is split into a list of strings. The
                                        output will automatically be displayed as you enter/paste your text,
                                        which you can copy directly from the page.

                            I have not started this project yet. It will essentially be a list of my recommended
                            programs, extensions, services, etc for all of my day-to-day activities. The goal is provide
                            not only a list of these programs, but a pseudo-database of them (aka. Local JSON) that is
                            easily searchable from the webpage itself.
